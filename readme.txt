Snippets functionality with a custom post type, shortcode and optional Gutenberg block.

== Description ==

If your website shows the same content on multiple pages it's best to just keep one copy of this content and to edit that if you need to make site-wide changes.

The Blocksolid Snippets plugin lets you manage these "snippets" of content using a dedicated custom post type.

In the Classic Editor Snippets can be conjured using a simple shortcode such as:

[blocksolid_snippet post_title="My Snippet"]

If you use Gutenberg our included Snippets block allows you to choose your snippet from a list and live-preview it within your page.

Your snippet can contain formatted text, images, videos, [shortcodes], HTML, gutenberg blocks, any valid WordPress content.

If you are using our separate Blocksolid plugin as a page builder and Gutenberg overlay the Blocksolid Snippets plugin also integrates well with this.

= Blocksolid Snippets Features =

* Snippets of code are contained in a custom post type that can then be called via a Gutenberg block or a simple shortcode

== Installation ==

* Install the plugin using the WordPress 'Add New plugin' functionality and activate.

* Once activated a new Snippets menu item will appear in your WordPress menu to allow you to create new snippets of content.

* Give each of your snippets a unique title e.g. "My Snippet".

* You can then call your snippet via a short code like [blocksolid_snippet post_title="My Snippet"]

* if you use the built-in Gutenberg block editor for your website you can use the plugin's bespoke 'Snippets' block to place the snippet within your content.

* The Snippets block give you a live preview of your snippet within the Gutenberg editor.
